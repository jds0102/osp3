3rd project for cs537 operating systems, implementing RAiD

WEDNESDAY - JOEY AND AARON BEGAN RAID 4
Comments that need to be considered later:
  1. Should we always recover even if we cant recover anything?
  2. Should write with failed parity disk generate an error
  3. NEED TO CHECK FOR WRITE ERRORS (have not done for RAID 0/10)
